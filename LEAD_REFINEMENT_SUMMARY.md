## ✅ 4. Refined Detailed Analysis (Executive Language)
**Sharpened all explanations** from conversational to analytical consulting tone.

**Example Transformation:**

Applied to all 5 analysis sections:
- Budget Analysis
- Need Alignment
- Urgency Signal
- Authority Assessment

Bullet points made more analytical:

## ✅ 6. Enhanced Risk Assessment (Color-Coded)
**New visual risk level indicator:**

```
Risk Level: 🟡 Medium
Primary Concerns:

```

Color coding:

- 🔴 **High** = #ef4444 (Red)

✨ **Result:** Structured, executive-friendly risk summary. Clear decision support.

## ✅ 7. NEW SECTION: "Recommended Sales Strategy"
**Three strategic components:**

1. **Recommended Approach**  
   (e.g., "Consultative / Executive-focused")

2. **Key Messaging Angle**  
   (e.g., "ROI and strategic impact metrics, emphasizing customer lifetime value increase")

3. **Engagement Recommendation**  
   (e.g., "Schedule executive-level demo within 24 hours")

✨ **Result:** Sales team gets **immediate, actionable guidance**. Platform demonstrates deep sales intelligence.

## ✅ 9. Professional Tone Applied Throughout
